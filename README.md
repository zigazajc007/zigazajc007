## Hi there, I'm Žiga Zajc – Founder of [Rabbit Company](https://rabbit-company.com) 🐇

I'm a full-stack developer and open-source enthusiast, passionate about building privacy-focused, self-hostable software. I started programming at age 12 with Minecraft plugins, got into C++ game hacking, then web development – and eventually founded Rabbit Company to deliver robust tools for individuals and businesses.

Today, I manage both personal and professional server infrastructures (yes, I love Linux), and I’m working toward making a living from my own open-source projects. I still work part-time for an external company, but my long-term goal is to fully focus on Rabbit Company and contribute to the open-source world.

**Everything I build is open-source and privacy-respecting.**
